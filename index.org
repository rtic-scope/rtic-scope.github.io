* About
*RTIC Scope* is a zero-overhead framework for recording and analyzing execution traces from [[https://rtic.rs][RTIC applications]] on ARMv7-M targets.
The lack of overhead is achieved by exploiting the ITM/DWT subsystem as defined by the [[https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/ed/][ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual]], Appendix D4.

** Features
The framework is split into three chief components: the canonical backend, the frontend(s), and the target-side tracing crate, ~cortex-m-rtic-trace~.

- The backend :: is a host-side (i.e., the system that programs the target device) application which exposes two operations:
  - Tracing :: where the target is flashed with the wanted firmware and the execution trace is captured and saved to file.
  - Replaying :: where previously recorded traces are replayed for postmortem and offline analysis.
- Frontend(s) :: While tracing and replaying, a trace can be forwarded to a set of frontends via Unix domain sockets where virtually endless analytics can be applied.
  Consider, for example, a graphical frontend alike an oscilloscope or a logic analyzer, but instead of signals the RTIC tasks and their executation statuses (running, scheduled, preempted) are plotted.

  A dummy frontend (used for debug and reference purposes) is available out of the box.

  At present, information only flows from the backend to the frontend.
  This is subject to change following a post-v1.0.0 release.
  With bidirectional communication a frontend can for example implement a complex hardware-in-the-loop testing suite.
  Please refer to the [[Roadmap][project roadmap]].
- The target-side tracing crate :: ~cortex-m-rtic-trace~, is an small auxiliary crate applied to the target application under trace.
  It only exposes the =#[trace]= macro, which is used to trace RTIC software tasks.
  While hardware tasks are traced "free of charge" (see [[How it works]]), software tasks are traced by writing a single =u32= variable.

** Project repositories/crates
The framework is managed under the [[https://github.com/rtic-scope][RTIC Scope organization on GitHub]].
Below is a list of the chief repositories that constitute the project.
Any other crates listed under the organization but not here are branches of other repositories pending upstream merge.

- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope][cargo-rtic-scope]] :: The RTIC Scope backend which builds the target application, recovers trace information, traces the target, replays traces, etc.
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/cortex-m-rtic-trace][cortex-m-rtic-trace]] :: The ~no_std~ crate used to configure the target for tracing purposes.
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/examples][examples]] :: A set of example target applications where the RTIC Scope framework is applied. These are also [[Examples][documented below]].
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/api][api]] :: The common API used between the RTIC Scope backend and all frontends.
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/frontend-dummy][frontend-dummy]] :: A "noop" frontend implementation that writes received =api::EventChunk= structs to stderr with nanosecond timestamp information.
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/itm-decode][itm-decode]] :: A host-side library that decodes the binary trace stream received from the target to workable Rust structures.
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/rfcs][rfcs]] :: A catch-all meta-repository for discussions that encompasses more than a single repository.
- [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/rtic-scope.github.io][rtic-scope.github.io]] :: The source code for this page.

* Requirements
** Hardware
- A target device with an ARMv7-M MCU.
- A CMSIS-DAP hardware probe supported by ~probe-rs~ /or/ serial hardware that expose a serial device which reads the trace stream from the target.

** Software
- A Linux-based operating system on which a recent Rust toolchain. MSRV TBA.

* Getting started
Install the backend and reference frontend via
#+begin_src fundamental
  $ cargo install --git https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope.git
  $ cargo install rtic-scope-frontend-dummy
#+end_src

** Examples
*** blinky
Assuming you have a STM32F401 Nucleo-64 at hand, let us trace a simple blinky application:

#+end_src

We can read from the ~dummy~ frontend that toggling a LED takes about 21µs in debug mode.

* How it works
** The ITM/DWT subsystem
Over serial communication a stream of back-to-back ITM packets are received.
Each packet contains a header and a number of payload bytes.
Of special interest are exception trace packets:
#+begin_quote
The DWT unit can generate an Exception trace packet whenever then processor enters, exits, or returns to an exception.
--- Appendix D4.3.2
#+end_quote
This packet then contains one of the exception numbers listed in the table below.
These numbers are bound to RTIC tasks.

#+CAPTION: ARMv7-M Exception numbers
#+ATTR_HTML: :rules all
| Exception number | Exception name/label |
|------------------+----------------------|
|                1 | Reset                |

|                3 | HardFault            |
|                4 | MemManage            |
|                5 | BusFault             |
|             7-10 | Reserved             |

|               12 | DebugMonitor         |
|               13 | Reserved             |
|               14 | PendSV               |
|               15 | SysTick              |
|               16 | External interrupt 0 |
|                . | .                    |
|                . | .                    |
|                . | .                    |
|           16 + N | External interrupt N |
|------------------+----------------------|

Henceforth, this document will refer to these exceptions/interrupt numbers as interrupt request (IRQ) numbers.

Software tasks are similarly traced, but come at a cost of a =u32= variable write when entering and exiting the task.
This variable is registered as a watch address in the DWT subsystem.
Any writes to this address are intercepted, and the new value is encapsulated in an ITM packet along with the ID of the DWT comparator.

** Host-side information recovery
The IRQ numbers we receive in a packet must be associated back to the correct RTIC tasks.
This is done in a preparatory step before the target is flashed and traced.
For example, when executing =cargo rtic-scope --bin blinky --chip stm32f401re=:
1. ~blinky~ is build via a regular =cargo build --bin blinky=.
2. The RTIC application declaration, =#[app(...)] mod app {...}=, is parsed from ~blinky~'s source code.
   From this declaration, the =#[app(device = ...)]= argument is extracted along with the IRQ label from each =#[task(binds = ...)]= macro occurance.
   Additionally, software tasks traced using the =#[trace]= macro are enumerated and mapped.
   For example, =device = stm32f4::stm32f401=, =binds = SysTick=, and =binds = EXTI1= might be extracted.
   Here, each IRQ label is associated with the RTIC task it is bound to.

   This parsing step places some restrictions on how the source code for an RTIC application can be written. Refer to [[Limitations]].
3. An adhoc cdylib crate is then built which translates IRQ labels to IRQ numbers.
   For example, the adhoc crate might contain
   #+begin_src rust
     use stm32f4::stm32f401::Interrupt;

     // Only external interrupts need be written here.
     // Exceptions-bound tasks are resolved using the above table.

     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern fn rtic_scope_func_EXTI1() -> u8 {
         Interrupt::EXTI1.nr()
     }
   #+end_src
   After loading the resultant shared library and calling all functions, a ~IRQ number -> IRQ label -> RTIC task~ map ("task map") is yielded.

Along with the task map, an absolute timestamp must also be calculated for each set of trace packets received.[fn:1]
This is done by sampling the time just before the target is reset and by reading the trace clock frequency via the CMSIS-DAP probe.

This ~(task map, reset timestamp, trace clock frequency)~ tuple constitutes the metadata of a trace, and is saved as a header to all trace files.

* Limitations
** Dropped ITM packets
If the input buffer of the serial device is filled, packets will be lost or corrupted.
A warning will be printed before this buffer is overflowed, or if the buffer size cannot be found.

** RTIC application constrains
At present, the ~device~ argument of the RTIC app macro, i.e. =#[app(device = stm32f4::stm32f401, ...)]=, is interpreted as a crate name and feature combination.
In this example, ~stm32f4~ is interpreted as the crate name, and ~stm32f401~ as the crate feature when building the adhoc cdylib crate.
Additionally, the ~Interrupt~ enum of this peripheral access crate is expected at =stm32f4::stm32f401::Interrupt=.
[[https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/issues/22][This contraint is planned to be lifted]].
See [[https://github.com/rtic-scope/examples/blob/master/src/bin/blinky-noconf.rs][the examples]] for how to write an RTIC Scope compliant RTIC application.

** Target-side overhead
When tracing software tasks:
- a DWT comparator must be effectively consumed.
  Additionally, the ID of the comparator must be communicated to the backend by writing the value to a watch address.
- When entering/exiting a software task marked for tracing, a =u8= (at minimum) must be written to a watch addess;
  a =u32= in the worst case (depending on the number of tracing software tasks[fn:2]).

* Frequently asked questions
- Where are all build artifacts stored? :: Most likely under ~target/~, assuming the current working directory is a crate containing target applications.
  The target directory can be overridden via =TARGET_DIR= or the =--target-dir= option.
  Note that the RTIC application will be rebuilt to this location.

  ~cargo rtic-scope~ also respecets [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html][Cargo's configuration system]].
- Where are all traces saved to? :: Recorded traces are serialized to JSON to ~/path/to/target-dir/rtic-traces~, which means ~target/rtic-traces~ by default.
  This directory can be overridden via the ~--trace-dir~ option.
  The same option  is used to replay traces located in non-default location.

  *NOTE:* any traces saved to the target directory will be lost on a =cargo clean=.

* Roadmap
A minimum viable product release can be expected as soon as [[https://github.com/orgs/rtic-scope/projects/1][all cards of this project]] are in the "Done" column.
The MVP only traces hardware tasks.
Software task tracing is not yet fully implemented.
A [[https://github.com/orgs/rtic-scope/projects/2][tracking project]] is also available for a v1.0.0 release.

* Footnotes
[fn:2] The overhead will be =u8= unless your application has more than 256 software tasks.

[fn:1] An absolute timestamp /mustn't/ be calculated, but they come in handy.
